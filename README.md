The Final Hunt 🕵️‍♂

Pssst...? Don’t know where to start? 🤔 Don’t worry, Marcelle wasn’t exactly a master at keeping things hidden... (Just like his emotions, which led people to thinking he was a bit off. 😅) But hey, look carefully enough, and you might just stumble upon something. Ready? Let’s go... 👀

Clue 1:
"Unlock the hidden truth, the flag is the key." ✈ 🏢

Clue 2:
"Amid the chaos, his voice was but a faint echo..." 📣

Clue 3:
"The little mother... A doll perhaps?" 🪆

Clue 4:
"Sometimes all you need is a closer look." 👁

Clue 5:
"A man’s discontent drives him to seek, yet all he needs is already within." 🤷‍♂

Whew... with all that said, to you my dear explorer, hope you find what you're looking for... 🌈✨
Good luck little one. The journey’s just beginning. 🌍🛤️
